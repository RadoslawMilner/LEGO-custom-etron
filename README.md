# LEGO Custom Audi RS Q e-tron

Welcome to the development repository for my custom-built LEGO Audi RS Q e-tron variant. This project explores different motorized drivetrain and steering configurations using LEGO Powered Up components and Pybricks firmware.

## Repository Structure

- **/stable/**  
  Verified and working programs used in completed builds.  
  Reliable for reuse, demonstration, and driving.

- **/experimental/**  
  Concepts, early-stage ideas, and untested programs.  
  For iteration and future development.

## Key Features

- Full support for 4-motor direct-drive (skid-steer and hybrid) setups
- Remote control with LEGO 88010 remote
- Track and wheel variants
- Modular design with acceleration, turning logic, and hub battery feedback
- Built and tested with Pybricks on LEGO Technic Hub

## Requirements

- LEGO Technic Hub (Control+ / 4-port)
- LEGO 88010 Remote
- Pybricks firmware
- LEGO motors (L or XL) depending on configuration
- LEGO wheels and/or tracks

## Getting Started

1. Flash your Technic Hub with [Pybricks](https://code.pybricks.com)
2. Clone this repository
3. Upload any script from /stable to your Hub using Pybricks Code or your preferred method (e.g., terminal, console).
4. Control with the 88010 remote and enjoy

## Status

Project is active. Currently driving and testing multiple variants, including:
- 4WD full skid steering (option 7) â€” **working**
- Rear drive with front passive wheel steering â€” **in development**
